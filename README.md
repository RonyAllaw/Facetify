# Facetify
The Purpose of facetify is to identify faces in a gallery of photos and then categorize the unknown pictures and the known pictures in their respective folders.
The FaceNet pretrained model was used for this project, which was good enough for the purposes of the project, but there was bias towards caucasian males.
Using a dataset of 25 thousand pictures, 5000 triplets were produced for a siamese network, in order to skew the racial bias in a more equitable manner.
